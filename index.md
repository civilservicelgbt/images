You can add images to the repository by <a href="{{ site.github-repo | append: 'tree/main/images' }}" target="_blank">uploading them to GitHub</a>.

All files are grouped by their parent folder. Any files not placed into folders will display under “unfiled”.

If you have recently uploaded a new file to the directory, it can take several minutes to appear in this list.
